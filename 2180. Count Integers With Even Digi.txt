Hint
Given a positive integer num, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to num whose digit sums are even.

The digit sum of a positive integer is the sum of all its digits.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
The only integers less than or equal to 4 whose digit sums are even are 2 and 4.    
Example 2:

Input: num = 30
Output: 14
Explanation:
The 14 integers less than or equal to 30 whose digit sums are even are
2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28.

Code:
class Solution {
    public int countEven(int num) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=num;i++){
            if(iseven(i)){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    public boolean iseven(int n){
        int result=0;
        while(n>0){
            int temp=n%10;
            result+=temp;
            n=n/10;
        }
        if(result%2==0){
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

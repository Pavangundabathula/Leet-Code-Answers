Hint
Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
s only consists of a, b or c characters.

Code:

class Solution {
    public int numberOfSubstrings(String s) {
        int[] count = {-1, -1, -1}; 
        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            count[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i; 
            if (count[0] != -1 && count[1] != -1 && count[2] != -1) {
                result += 1 + Math.min(count[0], Math.min(count[1], count[2]));
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

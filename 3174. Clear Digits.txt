Hint
You are given a string s.

Your task is to remove all digits by doing this operation repeatedly:

Delete the first digit and the closest non-digit character to its left.
Return the resulting string after removing all digits.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"

Output: "abc"

Explanation:

There is no digit in the string.

Example 2:

Input: s = "cb34"

Output: ""

Explanation:

First, we apply the operation on s[2], and s becomes "c4".

Then we apply the operation on s[1], and s becomes "".

 
Code:

class Solution {
    public String clearDigits(String s) {
        String answer=s;
        boolean is=false;
        int i=0;
        while(i<s.length()){
            char c=s.charAt(i);
            if(Character.isDigit(c)){
                answer=s.substring(0,i-1)+s.substring(i+1);
                s=answer;
                i=0;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return answer;
    }
}

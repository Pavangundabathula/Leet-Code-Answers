Hint
Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

Code:

class Solution {
    public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
        int count=0;
        int len=0;
        int maxlen=0;
        int l=0;
        int r=0;
        while(r<nums.length){
            if(count==k && nums[r]==0){
                while(count==k){
                    if(nums[l]==0){
                        count--;
                    }
                    len--;
                    l++;
                }
            }
            if(nums[r]==0){
                count++;
            }
            len++;
            r++;
            maxlen=Math.max(len,maxlen);
        }
        return maxlen;
    }
}
